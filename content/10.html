<h1> Notes on Biology. The Krebs cycle. </h1><B>The Krebs cycle</b>, also known as the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle, is a series of biochemical reactions that occur in the mitochondria of cells. <p>It is a vital metabolic pathway that is used for energy production and the synthesis of critical molecules in the cell. The cycle involves a series of reactions that take place between acetyl-CoA, oxaloacetate, and other intermediates such as citrate and Î±-ketoglutarate. During the cycle, acetyl-CoA is broken down and oxidized to create carbon dioxide and energy in the form of ATP and NADH. <p>This energy is then used in other metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway.</P>The Krebs cycle was first discovered by Hans Adolf Krebs in 1937.It is thought to be one of the oldest metabolic pathways in the world and is present in many organisms, including plants, animals, and bacteria.It is believed that the ancient bacteria that first used the Krebs cycle were anaerobicand were capable of using organic molecules as a source of energy.</body>
