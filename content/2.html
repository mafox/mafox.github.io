<h1> Notes on Biology. Prokaryote and Mitochondria. </h1>Prokaryote: Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms that do not possess a cell nucleus or membrane-bound organelles. They include bacteria and archaea and are the most abundant organisms on earth. Prokaryotes have small, circular DNA molecules called plasmids that are separate from the larger chromosome. Mitochondria: Mitochondria are the energy factories of cells. They are responsible for converting energy from food into a form that the cell can use. Mitochondria have their own DNA, which is separate from the DNA of the cell and is inherited maternally.</body>
