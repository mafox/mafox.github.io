<h1> Notes on Biology. The earliest lifeform. </h1>The earliest known lifeform on Earth is believed to be a single-celled organism called a prokaryote. Prokaryotes are simple, single-celled organisms that lack a nucleus, mitochondria, and other membrane-bound organelles. Prokaryotes are believed to have first appeared on Earth between 3.5 and 3.8 billion years ago, and they have the ability to survive in a wide variety of environments, including extremely hot and cold temperatures and environments with low oxygen levels. Prokaryotes are capable of metabolizing food, obtaining energy from their environment, and reproducing through asexual reproduction.</body>
